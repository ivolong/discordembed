# Discord Webhook with PHP
This is a very simple script that posts to Discord Webhooks and allows you to use embeds (title, description, color etc.) that make Discord Bot messages look nice.

Please refer to this for adding, removing and changing embedded objects https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/resources/channel#embed-object
