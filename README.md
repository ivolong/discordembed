# Discord Embed with PHP
This is an easy script that posts to Discord hebhooks and allows you to use embedded objects (title, description, color etc.) that make Discord bot messages look nice.

Please refer to this for adding, removing and changing embedded objects https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/resources/channel#embed-object
